          <h2>About Tatras</h2>
          <p>
            <img class="mountain" src="./images/mountain.jpg" alt="mountain">
            The Tatra Mountains occupy an area of 785 square kilometres, of which about 610 km² lie within Slovakia and about 175 km² within Poland.
            The highest peak, called Gerlach, at 2,655 m, is located north of Poprad, entirely in Slovakia.
            The highest point in Poland, Rysy, at 2,499 m, is located south of Zakopane, on the border with Slovakia.
            The Tatras are protected by law by the establishment of the Tatra National Park, Slovakia and the Tatra National Park, Poland,
            which are jointly entered in UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most notable mammals are the Tatra chamois, marmot, snow vole, brown bear, wolf, Eurasian lynx, red deer, roe deer, and wild boar.
            I already met a Tatra chamois and a brown bear when I was walking in the mountains!!!

          <p>
          <img class="house" src="./images/architecture.jpg" alt="wooden house"><br/>
          I like the architecture of Zakopane,
          it's almost wooden houses (maybe it will interests Laurens?) that seem to come from a fairy count.
          </p>
          <p>
          <img class="horse" src="./images/horse.jpg" alt="horse riding in Tatras moutains">
          Zakopane is visited by over 2,500,000 tourists a year.
          In the winter, Zakopanes tourists are interested in winter sports activities
          such as skiing, snowboarding, ski jumping, snowmobiling, sleigh rides, snowshoe walks, and Ice skating.
          During the summer, Tourists come to do activities like hiking, climbing, bike and horse ride the Tatras mountain,
          there are many trails in the Tatras.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Zakopane you can eat delicious dishes for really cheap. Mniam Mniam.
            The local spaciality is called <em>oscypek</em>, it is a smoked sheep cheese.
            But my favorite are the <em>nalesniki</em> with chesse or red fruits, it is a kind of pancakes.
